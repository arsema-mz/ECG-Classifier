# ECG Signal Classification Using Machine Learning 🫀🤖

This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system for classifying ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals to detect different types of heartbeats and cardiac abnormalities. It uses real clinical ECG data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset.

The project is currently **ongoing** and is being developed step by step, covering data loading, signal preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
